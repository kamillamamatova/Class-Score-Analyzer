# Class-Score-Analyzer
This Java program repeatedly prompts the user to enter test scores until they type –1. It counts the number of valid scores, how many are passing (70 or above), tallies A/B/C/D/F grade frequencies, calculates the average (rounded to two decimals), and then asks if the user wants to process another class before printing “Goodbye!” and exiting.
